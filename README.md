# Vita Caroli

_Vita Caroli_ is the autobiography written in Latin by the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire Charles IV during the early years of his reign. The text, which represents one of the most famous historiographic works written in Medieval Bohemia, dates back to about 1360 CE. The work narrates events up to 1340, with additions up to 1346, covering his youth and the beginning of his reign. The text represents a rare example of autobiographical literature from a Medieval ruler, and is one of the most representative texts of Latin spoken in the Czech lands.

The text was taken from the database [_Documenta latinitatis Bohemorum_](http://dlb.ics.cas.cz/), containing selected Medieval Latin texts of Czech origin. It is available there as part of the [_Fontes rerum Bohemicarum_](http://dlb.ics.cas.cz/browser?path=/1/20/45/46//47&text=47) collection.
